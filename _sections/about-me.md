I am an engineer and a researcher working in the field of AI. I am in the final year of my PhD candidacy at [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). 
My current research interest are [deep generative models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/notes/introduction/) e.g. see recently developed [spatial dependency nets](https://github.com/djordjemila/sdn) for image modeling.
I am enthusiastic about the impact of AI in medicine and biology -- see [our web platform for high-throughput analysis of sleep patterns](https://sleeplearning.ethz.ch/) used daily by academic and industrial researchers worldwide.
<br><br>


At ETH I work under the guidance of 
[Prof. Joachim. M. Buhmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.buhmann.html).
During my time at ETH, I collaborated with [Swiss AI lab IDSIA](http://idsia.ch/) led by [Prof Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/), 
with the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) led by [Prof. 
Bernhard Schölkopf](http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs) to which I am [affiliated](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/dmiladinovic), 
and with [the group of Prof. Steven Brown](https://www.pharma.uzh.ch/en/research/chronobiology/areas/chronobiology.html) in an interdisciplinary collaboration.
Previously, I worked in [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-ch) in Lausanne 
and in [Disney Research in Zürich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/about-us/) with [Dr. Paul Beardsley](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/people/paul-beardsley/) and [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges/).
I obtained my master's degree from ETH Zürich and my bachelor's degree from [School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en#gsc.tab=0), both in computer science.
<br><br>

I am originally from Serbia, born in [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade) in 1990, grew up in [Kruševac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kru%C5%A1evac). Correct English spelling of my name is Djordje Miladinovic 
while in Serbian it would be Đorđe Miladinović if you prefer [latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaj%27s_Latin_alphabet)
or Ђорђе Миладиновић if you fancy [cyrillic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet). If you can pronounce [Django](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/) or [Djokovic](https://novakdjokovic.com/en/) then you can also pronounce Djordje.
