I am a final year PhD candidate at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and an avid AI enthusiast. 
I design, develop and engineer AI software solutions and offer consulting services. 
My main research interest are [deep probabilistic (generative) models](https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/notes/introduction/) of natural data such as images, language and videos: I design [novel neural network architectures](https://openreview.net/forum?id=I4c4K9vBNny) and training procedures.
I am exceptionally interested in medical/biological applications and I strongly believe in the potential of AI to exploit vast amounts of raw/unlabeled data to enable personalized and efficient decision-making and accelerate scientific discovery e.g. see [our web platform for high-throughput automatic analysis of sleep recordings](https://sleeplearning.ethz.ch/) used by academic and industrial researchers worldwide, on a daily basis.

At ETH I work under the guidance of 
[Prof. Joachim. M. Buhmann](https://inf.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.buhmann.html).
Throughout the last 4 years there, I also collaborated with [Swiss AI lab IDSIA](http://idsia.ch/) led by [Prof Jürgen Schmidhuber](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/), 
with the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/) led by [Prof. 
Bernhard Schölkopf](http://ei.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/bs) to which I am [affiliated](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/dmiladinovic), 
and with [the group of Prof. Steven Brown](https://www.pharma.uzh.ch/en/research/chronobiology/areas/chronobiology.html) in an interdisciplinary collaboration.
Previously, I worked in the headquarters of [Logitech](https://www.logitech.com/en-ch) in Lausanne, 
and also in [Disney Research in Zurich](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/about-us/) under the supervision of [Dr. Paul Beardsley](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/people/paul-beardsley/) and [Prof. Otmar Hilliges](https://ait.ethz.ch/people/hilliges/).
I obtained my master's degree from ETH Zurich and my bachelor's degree from [School of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade](https://www.etf.bg.ac.rs/en#gsc.tab=0), both in computer science.

I am originally from Serbia; I was born in [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade) in 1990. but grew up in [Kruševac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kru%C5%A1evac). Correct English spelling of my name is Djordje Miladinovic 
while in Serbian we would write it Đorđe Miladinović if you prefer [latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaj%27s_Latin_alphabet)
or Ђорђе Миладиновић if you fancy [cyrillic letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_Cyrillic_alphabet). If you can pronounce [Django](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853728/), you can also pronounce Djordje.
