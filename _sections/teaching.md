During my time at ETH Zurich, I was involved in the organization and teaching of the following courses:

* [Advanced Machine Learning](https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/aml/) '17, '18, '19, '20
* [Statistical Learning Theory](https://ml2.inf.ethz.ch/courses/slt/) '18, '19

I also supervised a number of master students on various topics:
